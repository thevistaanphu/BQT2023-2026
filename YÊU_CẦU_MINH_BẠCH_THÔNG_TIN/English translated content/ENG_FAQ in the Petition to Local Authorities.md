# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) in the Petition to Local Authorities
## Why are the residents of The Vista submitting this petition?
Residents are submitting the petition due to various issues regarding the utilization of the maintenance and operational funds. The Management Board (BQT) for the 2023-2026 term has faced several unresolved concerns.

## What legal grounds does this petition rely on?
The petition is based on multiple legal documents, including:

Circular 05/2024/TT-BXD
Decision 26/2025/QĐ-UBND
Decree 02/2024/NĐ-CP
Decree 144/2021/NĐ-CP
Enterprise Law 2020
The Vista An Phú Condominium Rules and Regulations

## What are the financial issues at The Vista?
- Violations of transparency principles regarding the Maintenance Fund.
- Failure to provide regular Maintenance Fund reports as per standards.
- Non-compliance with resident consultation in fund usage.
- No disclosure of bank statements or accounts related to the 2024 Maintenance Fund.
- Lack of clear cost-sharing methods among owners, leading to disputes.
- Unauthorized decisions regarding fund usage without resident consultation.
## What are the issues with the 2024 Maintenance Fund plan?
- The plan violates regulations (e.g., lacks procedural compliance and legal basis for additional items).
- No transparency in assigning responsibilities among members for supervision and inspection.
- Proposals to use the Maintenance Fund incorrectly for items belonging to other operational funds.
- How does misuse of the Maintenance Fund impact residents?

The Maintenance Fund, collected at 2% of initial contributions, may require replenishment if misused, placing additional financial burdens on residents.

## Can the Maintenance Fund be used for other purposes if approved by the Condominium Assembly?
Legal regulations take precedence. If residents are misinformed and approve improper uses, the decision can be overturned, and intervention from authorities is required.

## The Management Board (BQT) claims to be too busy to consult all residents. Is this valid?
The BQT is responsible for overseeing and reporting fund usage. Residents must approve these actions, and specific members must be assigned and held accountable. Being "too busy" is not a valid excuse for bypassing these obligations.

## Is it true that the information is sent out but residents don’t review the information provided by the BQT?
The BQT must ensure all provided information is complete and accurate. If they have fulfilled their duties, they should not worry about scrutiny.

## How can these issues be resolved?
The first step is to audit and verify all actions taken by the 2023-2026 BQT. Identifying specific violations with data and understand why and how it happened is essential before proposing changes.

## Will publicizing these issues negatively impact property values or discourage good management teams?
Transparency is vital for long-term improvements. Other condominiums in Ho Chi Minh City have undergone similar processes to enhance governance.

## Why not wait until the current BQT’s term ends to address these issues?
Delaying action could perpetuate violations and set a precedent for future boards. Immediate transparency and reform are necessary for lasting improvements.

## What if the petition doesn’t prompt any action from the authorities?
Starting the process is crucial, even if the outcome is uncertain. Raising awareness among residents is the first step toward resolving these important issues.
