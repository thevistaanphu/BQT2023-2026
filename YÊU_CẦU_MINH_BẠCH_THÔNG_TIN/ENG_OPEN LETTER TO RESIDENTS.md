## OPEN LETTER TO RESIDENTS

Dear Residents,

Through several changes of the Management Board ('BQT') at The Vista An Phú, District 2, residents have reported several issues regarding the use of funds. Therefore, residents have called on the Management Board (BQT) for the 2023-2026 term to rectify the outstanding unlawful procedures to avoid complaints arising as in the past.

After the 2024 Condominium Conference ('HNNCC'), the BQT has continuously taken actions to block information, lack transparency, and failed to explain decisions. Security, cleaning, landscaping, and common utility services are deteriorating, while management fees have increased without a vote at the HNNCC. Therefore, since November 2024, I have directly attended meetings to clarify the use of funds and gain more information. Consequently, starting from March 2025, 4 residents (Mr. Lloyd, Ms. Giang, Ms. Hằng, Ms. Trâm) co-signed a request demanding the BQT provide access to information related to the use of the maintenance fund and the operating fund.

As of April 16, 2025, we have still not received a response from the BQT allowing access to information and providing the relevant data. Furthermore, the BQT continuously prohibits residents from sharing meeting content, forbids recording, and engages in provocative and inciting actions towards residents.

Due to concerns about abuses of power leading to losses for the Maintenance Fund and Operating Fund, and suspecting irregularities, we are writing the petition below to submit to the authorities via the national electronic information portal to update and resolve the issues.

We hope fellow residents will co-sign this petition to request that the government and relevant parties provide the necessary information and cease actions that obstruct transparency.

Residents can refer to some legal provisions regarding the Maintenance Fund and Operating Fund:
* Guidance on the principles and items for using the Maintenance Fund
* Distinguishing management costs and maintenance costs 
* Latest guidance on condominium management fees 
* Strict prohibition of using the maintenance fund for operational management tasks
* Can the maintenance fund be used for other purposes if approved by a vote at the Condominium Conference?
* Contracts and regulations handed over to owners when purchasing directly from Capital Land
