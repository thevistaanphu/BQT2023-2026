* Circular No. 26/2025/QĐ-UBND (Guiding the management and use of Condominiums in Ho Chi Minh City).
* Decree 02/2024/NĐ-CP (Regarding the transfer of electrical works to the Electricity Group).

* Enterprise Law 2020 (regarding principles of meetings, minute-taking, and transparency in governance for organizational models similar to boards of directors, if applied analogously according to the Condominium Internal Rules).
* Internal Rules and Regulations of The Vista An Phú Condominium, along with other regulations handed over by the Developer, Capital Land.

**II. COMPLAINT CONTENT**

**1. Regarding transparency in the disclosure of financial reports**

1.1. **Failure to periodically provide Maintenance Fund reports according to standards:** From December 2023 until now, the BQT has not disclosed necessary financial reports (Cash Flow Statement, Budget Control Report, Statement of Activities, Balance Sheet...) and related income-expenditure figures for the Maintenance Fund periodically, violating Articles 4 and 37 of Circular 05/2024 as well as the Condominium Internal Rules and Regulations.

1.2. **Failure to disclose bank statements and account information:** In 2024, the BQT did not provide detailed bank account statements confirmed by the bank and deposit tracking books related to the Maintenance Fund, contrary to the principle of publicity and transparency stipulated in the Housing Law and Circular 05/2024.

1.3. **Incomplete or missing Operating Fund reports:**
    * **2024:** The BQL only sent total income-total expenditure figures for the 2 HSBC accounts managed by CBRE and the Vietcombank account managed by the BQT (reports for months 1, 2, 6, 9, 11, 12), or did not send any monthly reports at all (months 3, 4, 5).
    * As of April 5, 2025, the BQL submitted a financial report, but many figures did not match, for example: the gym renovation cost (66,560,520 VND) previously reported did not appear in the "Report of Actual Income-Expenditure on behalf of the Operating Fund compared to the budget for July 2024 – December 2024".
    * Some items reported negative costs without explanation.
    * The BQT did not provide information on the method of allocating costs by area and by owner – violating the condominium management and use regulations.

=> These actions infringe upon the residents' right to oversight, potentially leading to loss, misuse, or misappropriation of the Maintenance Fund – a financial resource strictly protected by law under Article 37 of Circular 05/2024 and Article 155 of the Housing Law 2023.

**2. Regarding transparency in the use of the Maintenance Fund**

2.1. **The 2024 Maintenance Fund usage plan violates regulations:** The plan sent to residents in May 2024 did not comply with Articles 31, 33 of Circular 05/2024 (regarding submission procedures, percentage contributions of owners, and agreement through the Condominium Conference - HNCC).
    * Failure to prove the legal basis for including additional items (maintenance of generator systems, BMS, wastewater treatment, tile replacement, painting sauna ceilings...);
    * Violates the principle that it can only be used for common ownership areas, corresponding to the contributed area.

2.2. **Failure to publicly disclose the responsibilities and powers of each BQT member:** The BQT did not clearly announce who is responsible for inspecting, supervising, and accepting each item, contrary to legal regulations and failing to ensure transparency when issues arise regarding acceptance and completion.

2.3. **Proposing the use of the Maintenance Fund against principles:**
    * According to Articles 145, 155 of the Housing Law 2023, Article 37 of Circular 05/2024, and Decree 02/2024/NĐ-CP, the Maintenance Fund can only be used for areas under common ownership contributed by residents.
    * The BQT did not clearly divide the cost ratio when some buildings or areas within the complex have different ownership.
    * The BQT proposed using the Maintenance Fund for items that actually belong to the Operating Fund (lighting system, parking lot repairs, CCTV system, BQL office renovation...) - legality not yet proven.
    * Requesting residents to approve maintenance costs for the MSB item belonging to the EVN network lacks a clear legal basis.

2.4. **Violations of the principles of publicity and transparency:**
    * Failure to publicize and obtain resident votes on activities using maintenance funds, selection of banks, terms, and interest rates for Maintenance Fund deposits.
    * Arbitrarily changing the content of resident ballot slips (from "repair" to "replace" the parking management system) and collecting additional arising fees, not following the correct procedure for collecting opinions.
    * Independently selecting maintenance contractors (like Megatech, chosen from March 2024 with a 50% cost increase compared to 2023) without publicly disclosing the contract at the HNCC.
    * Transferring 38,694,600 VND from the Maintenance Fund to cover Operating Fund expenses and for other operational management items, contrary to the provisions of Article 37 of Circular 05/2024 and the Housing Law 2023.

**3. Regarding transparency in the use of the Operating Fund**

3.1. **The 2024 Operating Fund usage plan contravenes regulations:**
    * Failure to collect and synthesize resident opinions at least 14 days before finalizing the budget plan (violating the Condominium Internal Rules and Regulations).
    * Arbitrarily increasing the management fee to 21,500 VND/m² without HNCC approval, without clearly explaining the allocation of increased costs (security costs increased by 230 million to 407 million VND/month, a 43% increase).
    * Failure to clearly disclose the corresponding replacement and repair cost ratios for other owners.

3.2. **Exceeding the BQT's scope of authority:**
    * Stopped collecting fees for the P1 parking area (150 parking spaces) and then declared P1 belongs to another party (Oxygen), without a resident vote.
    * Added items not approved by residents (ornamental fish care, separating CBRE project personnel, removing the receptionist position at the lobby...).
    * Independently deciding on the auditing unit and disbursing audit fees without HNCC approval.
    * Failure to organize resident opinion collection every 6 months.
    * Arbitrarily increasing remuneration for the BQT compared to the issued regulations.
    * Continuing to sign tripartite contracts with contractors despite residents requesting the abolition of the MST (Tax Identification Number/Management Service Team - *clarification might be needed depending on context*), concerned about overlapping responsibilities and lack of transparency.

**4. Other issues concerning the BQT (term from 2023 to present)**

4.1. **Restricting residents' right to access information:**
    * Failure to facilitate residents' access to documents proving figures in financial reports, despite many contradictions (e.g., the gym cost of 66,560,520 VND).
    * Failure to provide complete information despite multiple written requests from residents, even engaging in obstruction, insults, and incitement when residents requested clarification.

4.2. **Decisions contrary to HNCC regulations and inconsistent with Circular 05/2024:**
    * Failure to comply with regulations on invalid ballots, arbitrarily omitting the BQT seal on important documents.
    * The BQT personnel structure does not ensure the minimum number of representatives for each building;
    * Did not go through the nomination and election process according to proper procedures.
    * The BQT arbitrarily appointed the Head and Deputy Head of the BQT without consulting residents;
    * Failure to prove completion of condominium operation management training courses.
    * Failure to fulfill the responsibility of managing building data - lack of timely minutes and reports to residents regarding the status of lost original handover documents from the Developer, Capital Land.
    * Failure to update and supplement the BQT's operational regulations and financial collection-expenditure regulations according to Article 24 of Circular 05/2024.
    * Engaging in acts of inciting residents, causing insecurity and disorder in the condominium area, violating Decree 144/2021/NĐ-CP.
